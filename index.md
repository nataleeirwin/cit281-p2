# Project 2

This project helped gain experience using git via your CLI and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Source Control, gain experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code, and practice refactoring JavaScript code. Source code files can be found on GitHub at [this](https://github.com/nataleeirwin/cit281-p2) link

### Elements

- Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create and work with a git repository (repo)
- Refactor the JavaScript program from the previous project to practice using git and practice refactoring
- Use git via VSCode
